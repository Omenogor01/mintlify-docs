# Introduction to Snippets: Reuse Content Efficiently

## Introduction
One of the core principles of software development is **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**. This principle applies to documentation as well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

Snippets allow you to reuse content across your documentation, ensuring consistency and simplifying updates.

## Benefits of Using Snippets

1. **Consistency**: Keep your content consistent across multiple pages.
2. **Efficiency**: Save time by reusing existing content instead of rewriting it.
3. **Simplified Updates**: Update a snippet once, and the changes are reflected everywhere itâ€™s used.
4. **Improved Maintenance**: Reduce the risk of outdated or conflicting information.

## When to Use Snippets

- **Repeated Content**: Use snippets for content that appears in multiple places, such as disclaimers, FAQs, or reusable instructions.
- **Dynamic Content**: Create snippets with variables to customize content for different contexts.
- **Shared Components**: Use snippets for shared UI components or code examples.

## Example: Creating a Custom Snippet

### Step 1: Create a Snippet File
Create a new file in the `snippets` directory. For example:
```plaintext
/snippets/example-snippet.mdx
```

### Step 2: Add Content to the Snippet File
Add the content you want to reuse in the snippet file. For example:
```markdown
This is a reusable snippet. You can customize it with variables like **{{variableName}}**.
```

### Step 3: Import and Use the Snippet
Import the snippet in your documentation file and use it with custom values. For example:
```markdown
import ExampleSnippet from '/snippets/example-snippet.mdx';

<ExampleSnippet variableName="custom value" />
```
