  introduction: |
    Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a critical email authentication protocol that helps prevent spoofing and phishing attacks. By configuring SPF records in your DNS, you can specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain.
  components:
    - title: "SPF Record Components"
      description: |
        An SPF record is a DNS TXT record that defines the mail servers authorized to send emails for your domain. Below is an example of a basic SPF record:
      code: |
        ```dns
        v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:servers.mcsv.net -all
        ```
      explanation:
        - "v=spf1: Specifies the version of SPF being used."
        - "include:_spf.google.com: Authorizes Google’s mail servers to send emails on behalf of your domain."
        - "include:servers.mcsv.net: Authorizes Mailchimp’s servers to send emails."
        - "-all: Indicates a hard fail for unauthorized servers. Emails from unauthorized servers will be rejected."

bestPractices:
  - "Keep SPF records simple to avoid exceeding the DNS lookup limit (10 lookups)."
  - "Use '-all' for enforcement after testing with '~all' (soft fail)."
  - "Combine SPF with DKIM and DMARC for comprehensive email authentication."
  - "Monitor SPF results using DMARC reports to identify and resolve issues."
