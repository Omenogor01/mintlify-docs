## Implementation Roadmap

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Infrastructure Setup">
    Set up a dedicated IP address and warm it up gradually to build a positive sender reputation.
    ```bash
    # Dedicated IP warmup schedule
    DAY 1-7: 500 emails/day
    DAY 8-14: 1,000 emails/day
    DAY 15+: Scale based on engagement metrics
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Authenticate Your Emails">
    Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to authenticate your emails and prevent spoofing.
    ```dns
    # Example SPF record
    v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all

    # Example DKIM record
    default._domainkey IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA..."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Optimize Email Content">
    - Avoid spammy words like "FREE," "LIMITED TIME," or "ACT NOW."
    - Maintain a healthy text-to-image ratio (e.g., 60% text, 40% images).
    - Include a clear call-to-action (CTA) and an easy-to-find unsubscribe link.
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Monitor Engagement Metrics">
    Use tools like Google Postmaster Tools or SendGrid to track open rates, click-through rates, and bounce rates. Adjust your strategy based on the data.
  </Step>
</Steps>
