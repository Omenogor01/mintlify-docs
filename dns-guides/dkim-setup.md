# Complete DKIM Setup Guide

## Introduction
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email authentication protocol that allows you to sign your emails with a cryptographic signature. This ensures that your emails are not tampered with during transit and helps improve your email deliverability by building trust with recipients and email providers.

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through the steps to generate DKIM keys, configure your DNS records, and test your DKIM setup.

## Why is DKIM Important?
1. **Email Authentication**: Verifies that your emails are sent from an authorized server.
2. **Improved Deliverability**: Reduces the chances of your emails being flagged as spam.
3. **Protection Against Spoofing**: Prevents attackers from impersonating your domain.

## Step-by-Step DKIM Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Generate DKIM Keys">
    Use the following commands to generate your DKIM private and public keys:
    ```bash
    openssl genrsa -out dkim-private.pem 2048
    openssl rsa -in dkim-private.pem -pubout -out dkim-public.pem
    ```
    - **`dkim-private.pem`**: This is your private key. Keep it secure and do not share it.
    - **`dkim-public.pem`**: This is your public key, which will be added to your DNS records.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="2. Configure DNS Record">
    Add the public key to your DNS as a TXT record. Replace `MIIBIjAN...` with your actual public key:
    ```dns
    default._domainkey IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA..."
    ```
    - **`default._domainkey`**: This is the selector for your DKIM record.
    - **`v=DKIM1`**: Specifies the DKIM version.
    - **`k=rsa`**: Indicates the key type.
    - **`p=`**: Contains your public key.

    Save the changes and allow time for DNS propagation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Test Configuration">
    Verify that your DKIM record is correctly configured using the following command:
    ```bash
    dig +short txt default._domainkey.yourdomain.com
    ```
    - If the record is correctly configured, the output will display your DKIM public key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues and Solutions

| **Error**              | **Solution**                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Signature invalid**   | Verify that the private and public keys match.   |
| **Body hash mismatch**  | Check your email's canonicalization settings.    |
| **DNS record not found**| Ensure the DKIM TXT record is correctly added.   |
| **Key too short**       | Use a 2048-bit key for better security.          |

## Tools for DKIM Validation
- **[Google Admin Toolbox](https://toolbox.googleapps.com)**: Check your DKIM records and email authentication.
- **[MXToolbox DKIM Lookup](https://mxtoolbox.com/DKIMLookup.aspx)**: Validate your DKIM DNS records.
- **[Mail Tester](https://www.mail-tester.com)**: Analyze your email's DKIM signature and overall deliverability.

## Best Practices for DKIM
1. **Use a Strong Key**: Always use a 2048-bit key for enhanced security.
2. **Rotate Keys Regularly**: Update your DKIM keys periodically to reduce the risk of compromise.
3. **Monitor Reports**: Use DMARC aggregate reports to monitor DKIM authentication results.
4. **Combine with SPF and DMARC**: DKIM works best when used alongside SPF and DMARC for comprehensive email authentication.
