# DKIM Configuration Guide: Secure Your Email Domain

## Introduction
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is a critical email authentication protocol that ensures your emails are not tampered with during transit. By signing your emails with a cryptographic signature, DKIM helps protect your domain from spoofing and phishing attacks while improving email deliverability.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of configuring DKIM, implementing key rotation strategies, and testing your setup to ensure your domain is secure.

## Step-by-Step DKIM Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Generate DKIM Keys">
    Use the following commands to generate your DKIM private and public keys:
    ```bash
    openssl genrsa -out dkim-private.pem 2048
    openssl rsa -in dkim-private.pem -pubout -out dkim-public.pem
    ```
    - **`dkim-private.pem`**: This is your private key. Keep it secure and do not share it.
    - **`dkim-public.pem`**: This is your public key, which will be added to your DNS records.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Add the Public Key to Your DNS">
    Add the public key to your DNS as a TXT record. Replace `MIIBIjAN...` with your actual public key:
    ```dns
    default._domainkey IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA..."
    ```
    - **`default._domainkey`**: This is the selector for your DKIM record.
    - **`v=DKIM1`**: Specifies the DKIM version.
    - **`k=rsa`**: Indicates the key type.
    - **`p=`**: Contains your public key.

    Save the changes and allow time for DNS propagation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Configure Your Mail Server">
    Update your mail server to use the private key for signing outgoing emails. For example, in Postfix:
    ```bash
    # Postfix DKIM configuration
    dkim-filter.conf:
    Domain yourdomain.com
    KeyFile /etc/dkim/dkim-private.pem
    Selector default
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Test Your DKIM Setup">
    Verify that your DKIM record is correctly configured using tools like:
    - [Google Admin Toolbox](https://toolbox.googleapps.com)
    - [MXToolbox DKIM Lookup](https://mxtoolbox.com/DKIMLookup.aspx)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Rotation Strategy

Regularly rotating your DKIM keys enhances security by reducing the risk of key compromise. Use the following cron job to automate key rotation every three months:
```bash
# Key rotation cron job
0 0 1 */3 * /usr/local/bin/rotate-dkim-keys
