# Understanding SPF: Protect Your Domain from Unauthorized Senders

## Introduction
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an essential email authentication protocol that helps prevent spoofing and phishing attacks. By specifying which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain, SPF ensures your emails are trusted by recipients and email providers.

In this guide, we’ll explore how SPF works, why it’s important, and how to set it up for your domain.

## How SPF Works

SPF works by adding a TXT record to your domain’s DNS settings. This record specifies which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain. When an email is sent, the recipient’s mail server checks the SPF record to verify the sender’s authenticity.

### Example SPF Record
```dns
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
