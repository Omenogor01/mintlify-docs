## Key Strategies for Advanced Email Deliverability

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. List Hygiene">
    Regularly clean your email list to remove inactive or invalid addresses. This reduces bounce rates and improves engagement.
    - **Best Practice**: Remove inactive addresses every 90 days.
    - **Tools**: Use email verification services like [ZeroBounce](https://www.zerobounce.net) or [NeverBounce](https://neverbounce.com).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="2. Infrastructure Setup">
    Optimize your email infrastructure to ensure reliable delivery.
    - **Feedback Loops**: Configure feedback loops to monitor spam complaints.
    ```bash
    # Example: Configure feedback loops in Postfix
    postfix -e "smtpd_recipient_restrictions = 
      check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10040"
    ```
    - **Dedicated IPs**: Use dedicated IP addresses for high-volume campaigns and warm them up gradually.
    - **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC**: Ensure these authentication protocols are properly configured.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="3. Content Optimization">
    Create high-quality, engaging email content to improve open and click-through rates.
    - Avoid spammy words like "FREE" or "LIMITED TIME."
    - Use a clear and compelling subject line.
    - Maintain a healthy text-to-image ratio (e.g., 60% text, 40% images).
  </Step>
</Steps>
