A spam score is a numerical value assigned to your email based on various factors that spam filters evaluate. The higher the score, the more likely your email will be flagged as spam. Common factors include:
- Content quality
- Email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Sender reputation
- HTML structure and formatting
