# DNS Validator: Ensure Your DNS Records Are Configured Correctly

## Introduction
DNS (Domain Name System) records are critical for ensuring the proper functioning of your domain, email, and other online services. Misconfigured DNS records can lead to email delivery issues, website downtime, and security vulnerabilities.

The DNS Validator is a tool designed to help you verify and troubleshoot your DNS records, ensuring they are correctly configured and optimized for performance and security.

## Features of the DNS Validator
1. **SPF Record Validation**:
   - Checks if your SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record is correctly configured to prevent email spoofing.

2. **DKIM Record Validation**:
   - Verifies the presence and correctness of your DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) record for email authentication.

3. **DMARC Record Validation**:
   - Ensures your DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) record is properly set up to protect your domain from phishing and spoofing attacks.

4. **MX Record Validation**:
   - Confirms that your MX (Mail Exchange) records are pointing to the correct mail servers for email delivery.

5. **A and CNAME Record Validation**:
   - Checks if your A and CNAME records are resolving to the correct IP addresses or domains.

6. **TXT Record Validation**:
   - Verifies the presence of TXT records for additional domain configurations, such as Google Workspace or Microsoft 365.

## Common DNS Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Missing SPF Record**
   - **Issue**: Emails from your domain are not authenticated.
   - **Solution**: Add an SPF record to your DNS settings. Example:
     ```
     v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
     ```

### 2. **Invalid DKIM Record**
   - **Issue**: DKIM signature verification fails.
   - **Solution**: Ensure your DKIM record matches the public key provided by your email provider.

### 3. **No DMARC Record**
   - **Issue**: Your domain is vulnerable to spoofing.
   - **Solution**: Add a DMARC record to your DNS settings. Example:
     ```
     v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com
     ```

### 4. **Incorrect MX Records**
   - **Issue**: Emails are not delivered to the correct mail server.
   - **Solution**: Update your MX records to point to the correct mail servers.
